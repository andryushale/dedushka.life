to Stuy's one and only NBA page. You might ask yourself this question: 
"Why should I look at this page, when I could just type nba.com?"
Well, I don't know. But if you do take your time to look at this page,
you will see that it is much cooler. Plus, this is 
<EM> Stuy's</EM> NBA page, not just any regular, boring
one.
<P>Now, on to the NBA stuff.
