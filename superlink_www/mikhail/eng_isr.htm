Could it really be true -- getting the working place for an olim ready by the moment of his coming to Israel? Dr. Iosef Kheyfets says: yes, this is possible for everyone.

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ALIYA IN ISRAEL <BR>
AND THE PROBLEM OF PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT </STRONG></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=BLUE><STRONG> <I> "EMPLOYMENT" </I> PROGRAM
</FONT></STRONG></CENTER> <br>

<dd>The number of scientists and engineers who emigrated from the former Soviet Union is usually more than the labor requirements of destination countries. So, professional employment of these people is a big and bitter problem  for them and for their new countries as well. 
<dd>In contrast to others, the State of Israel has some governmental programs  for successful absorption of scientists and engineers during their first years after repatriation. There are:
<dd> --hothouses of technology, <br>
<dd> --parks of high technologies, <br>
<dd> --grants from Ministry of absorption, <br>
<dd> --special programs, as: <i>BASAN, M.S.R., GILADI, </I> and some others.<br>
<dd> However, the possibilities of governmental programs are limited, and these programs cannot bring jobs to  all incoming scientists and engineers. Therefore, the problem of professional employment is hot and hard for this part of immigrants. 
<dd> Because of this bad situation, as well as the lesser social assistance immigrants receive in Israel compared to the USA and Germany, Jewish repatriation from the former Soviet Union had a sharp decrease during the last four years.
<dd> Therefore, Livna division of the Association <I> Scientists of the South </I> designed and developed the new program <FONT COLOR=BLUE><I> Employment </I> </FONT>, that put into practice a very different approach to this problem. This program moves a repatriate's search of employment from the time of absorption to the time <font color=blue><I> preceding emigration </I> </font> when the thought about emigration just appeared in his mind.
<dd> At this period of time, the future repatriate who is using the program  <FONT COLOR=BLUE><I> Employment </I> </FONT> can ascertain his opportunities on the market of employment, find out employers according to his specialty, and have the working contacts. All of that could be done without psychological stresses of his entire family.
<dd> If he wants, he can have an excursion trip to Israel, to look at Israel and meet his supposed employers. Only after that can he make the final decision about the expediency of repatriation.
<dd> In other words, <FONT COLOR=BLUE><I> the Employment program gives you a chance to investigate your opportunities in Israel's employment market before leaving your native country. </I></FONT>
This program allows you to proceed with the most important step in your life with open eyes. It lets you move to Israel with a working contract in your pocket.<br>
<dd> The main work for <FONT COLOR=BLUE><I> Employment program </I> </FONT> is done by  the Livna division of the Association <I> Scientists of the South. </I> Unfortunately, at present time, this program works on a self-supporting basis. Because of that, the volume of accomplished work is limited by the financial resources of repatriates.<br><br>
<dd> To take a load of worries from repatriates, authors and executives of this program are looking for sponsors, to finance the program with a sum of about $80-100 thousand per year. Such a support of our efforts would allow repatriates to use all of the possibilities of the program <I>Employment</I> free of charge!
